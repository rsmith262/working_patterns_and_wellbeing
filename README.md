# The Impact of Working Patterns on Physical Activity and Wellbeing

This project analyses the relationship between employment patterns — such as working from home, hybrid working, and office-based work — and physical exercise habits. Using survey data, I carried out data preparation, cleansing, feature engineering, and statistical analysis to explore how different working arrangements impact physical activity levels, wellbeing, and self-reported productivity. The project applies real-world data science techniques including correlation analysis, hypothesis testing, and data visualisation.
